# AWS & PHP Sample Codes

<em>AWS & PHP is a repository where you can find the sample code for the most popular aws service. Most of the time developers are looking for ready to stick code in no hassles and since AWS is growing day by day hence it good to have a place to help them.

Here you can find many PHP sample code like S3 upload, API, ElasticCache, SQS, SNS and so on. I  also wish to have those codes too which are very popular and sometimes hosted on AWS Cloud like RabbitMQ, Redis, Memcached, Varnish, etc.
 
Stick with me here and we are going together hiya!</em>
