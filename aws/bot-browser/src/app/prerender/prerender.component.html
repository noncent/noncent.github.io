    <h1>Prerender:</h1>
    <p>Static Generation and Server-side Rendering are two forms of pre-rendering. Prerender means that Framework
        generates
        HTML for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. It is better with
        performance
        and SEO</p>
