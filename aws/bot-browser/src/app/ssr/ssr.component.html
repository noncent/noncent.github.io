    <h1>SSR:</h1>
    <p>The SSR approach is good for building complex web applications that require user interaction, rely on a database,
        or
        where the content changes very often. This is because content on these sites changes very often and the users
        need to
        see the updated content as soon as theyâ€™re updated. It is also good for applications that have tailored content
        depending on who is viewing it and applications where you need to store user-specific data like email and user
        preference while also catering for SEO. An example of this is a large e-commerce platform or a social media
        site.</p>
